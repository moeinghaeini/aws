# Git Setup Instructions for AWS Projects

## Manual Git Setup Steps

Since the terminal commands aren't working in the current environment, please follow these manual steps to commit your AWS projects to GitHub:

### Step 1: Open Terminal
Open your terminal and navigate to the AWS projects directory:
```bash
cd "/Users/moeinghaeini/Desktop/Cloud Projects/aws"
```

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
```

### Step 3: Add Remote Origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/moeinghaeini/aws.git
```

### Step 4: Add All Files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: AWS Cloud Projects Collection

- Project 1: Containerized LMS Migration and Troubleshooting (ECS Fargate)
- Project 2: CI/CD Pipeline for GlobalMart E-Commerce Platform  
- Project 3: Proactive Monitoring & Security Auto-Remediation
- Project 4: Debugging a Broken Serverless Contact Form Workflow
- Project 5: Repair Shop Application Deployment on AWS

Each project includes:
- Complete source code
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Automated deployment scripts
- Comprehensive documentation
- Troubleshooting guides

Technologies used: ECS, Lambda, API Gateway, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, CodePipeline, Elastic Beanstalk, and more."
```

### Step 6: Push to GitHub
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Use the Setup Script

If you prefer, you can also run the automated setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup-git.sh
./setup-git.sh
```

## What Will Be Committed

The following projects and files will be pushed to your GitHub repository:

### Project Structure
