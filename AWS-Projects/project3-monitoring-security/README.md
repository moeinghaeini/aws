# Project 3: Proactive Monitoring & Security Auto-Remediation for EC2

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive monitoring and security auto-remediation system for EC2 instances using AWS CloudWatch, Lambda, and various security services. The system proactively monitors infrastructure health and automatically responds to security threats and performance issues.

## Architecture
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch Metrics, Logs, and Alarms
- **Security**: AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, Config
- **Auto-Remediation**: Lambda functions for automated responses
- **Notification**: SNS for alerts and notifications
- **Dashboard**: CloudWatch Dashboard for visualization
- **Compliance**: AWS Config for compliance monitoring

## Components
1. **CloudWatch Monitoring Setup**
2. **Security Monitoring (GuardDuty, Security Hub)**
