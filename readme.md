## üöÄ Getting Started

Each project includes:
- Complete source code
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Automated deployment scripts
- Comprehensive documentation
- Troubleshooting guides

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.6 installed
- Node.js >= 18 and npm >= 9 (for application projects)
- Docker (for containerized projects)
- Python 3.11+ (for Lambda functions)

### Quick Start
1. Navigate to any project directory
2. Review the README.md for specific instructions
3. Run the deployment script: `./scripts/deploy.sh`
4. Follow the post-deployment instructions

## üìö Learning Outcomes

After completing these projects, you will understand:

1. **Container Orchestration**: How to deploy and manage containerized applications on AWS
2. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Building automated deployment pipelines for continuous delivery
3. **Monitoring and Security**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring and automated security responses
4. **Serverless Architecture**: Building and debugging serverless applications
5. **Full-Stack Deployment**: Deploying complete applications with frontend, backend, and database

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

Each project is designed to use minimal AWS resources to keep costs low:
- t3.micro instances for compute
- db.t3.micro for databases
- Minimal storage configurations
- Auto-scaling to scale down when not in use
- Latest AWS services for optimal performance and cost efficiency

Estimated monthly cost per project: $10-30 (depending on usage)

## üîÑ Recent Updates (October 2025)
